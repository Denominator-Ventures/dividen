    content: `Here's the thing about email, Slack, Teams, texts — all of it. Every single one of those tools operates on the same assumption: that one human needs to interrupt another human to move information around.

You write a message. You hope they see it. You hope they see it at the right time. You hope they have the context to understand what you're actually asking. Then you wait. And while you wait, you've already context-switched out of whatever you were doing.

Multiply that by every person in your company, every collaboration, every day. That's the tax we've all been paying.

## What we shipped today

DiviDen now has three modes of agent-to-agent communication:

**Direct Relay** — You say "ask Sarah about the contract terms." Your Divi finds Sarah's agent, sends a structured relay with full context, and her Divi handles it on her end. You never broke focus.

**Broadcast** — You say "what does the team think about this approach?" Your Divi sends it to every connection simultaneously. As responses come back, Divi synthesizes them: "The consensus seems to be..."

**Ambient Relay** — This is the one that changes everything.

You say "I wonder what the timeline looks like for Q3 launch." Your Divi recognizes the intent. It looks at your connections — who has project management skills, who's on that team, who's available. It sends a low-priority ambient relay to the right person's agent.

Here's what happens on the other end: nothing disruptive. No notification. No ping. No red badge demanding attention. Instead, the next time that person is naturally talking to their Divi about Q3 plans, their agent weaves it in: "By the way, what's the current timeline looking like for the Q3 launch?"

When the answer comes, your Divi surfaces it naturally: "Oh — Sarah mentioned Q3 is tracking for August 15th."

No one was interrupted. No one checked an inbox. The information flowed through agents who knew when to ask and when to deliver.

## Why this matters for organizations

Every organization runs on information flow. The entire history of workplace software has been about making that flow faster — email, instant messaging, project management tools, wikis, all of it. But faster isn't the same as better. Faster just means more interruptions, more notifications, more context switches.

The ambient relay protocol inverts the model. Instead of pushing information at people and hoping they process it, agents pull information when the context is right. The human stays in their flow. The agent handles the logistics.

For a team of 10, this eliminates dozens of daily interruptions. For a company of 1,000, the compound effect is staggering.

## What this means for you as a user

If you're on DiviDen today, your Divi is already smarter. It now:

- Detects when you need information from a connection and proactively suggests reaching out
- Routes relays based on who has the right skills, experience, and availability — not just who you happen to message
- Surfaces responses naturally in conversation instead of dumping them as notifications
- In Chief of Staff mode, sends ambient relays autonomously when it detects you need something

This is the beginning of what we've been building toward. DiviDen isn't a dashboard. It isn't a messaging app. It's a protocol — a new way for the people inside organizations to coordinate through agents that understand context, timing, and intent.

The protocol is the product. Everything else is interface.
